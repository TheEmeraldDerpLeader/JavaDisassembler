# JavaDisassembler
A small Java class file disassembler in C++

Text prompt to select file to read, manipulation of code is in development, but I don't intend to make it usable through command prompt. Would rather orient project toward a library-header interface.

Probably should document stuff or add comments, but don't really want to for something this small.
